# The Really Short Version

_Forking GeoPlanet one place type at a time_.

# The Short Version

WoePlanet is Where On Earth (AKA WOE, also AKA GeoPlanet) data, smushed up with coordinate and boundary data from Flickr Shapes, Quattroshapes and Natural Earth Data (that's fancy talk for _polygons_) as well as concordances and other metadata rescued from `woe.spum.org` before it died and went offline.

# The Longer Version

A simple Flask based spelunker for visualising, poking into and querying WoePlanet data 

## Installation

```
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# ToDo

I can haz decent documentation please?
